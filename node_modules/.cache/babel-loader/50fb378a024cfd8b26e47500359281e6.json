This hardship may be attributed to a variety of problems like a lack of\n                    engagement or dyscalculia. However, first grade educators often times allow the student to continue onto the next grade, despite the student’s inability to meet the standard.\n                    As the student progresses onwards, he or she will continue to face difficulties to grasp the increasingly challenging math concepts. From 3rd to 10th grade,\n                    20% of students fail to meet the Common Core Standard set by Washington state. With math being a general requirement for education,\n                    it is critical for students to have a strong foundation of math concepts at an early age, so that they can succeed in their future schoolwork.\n                    </p>\n                <h4>Information Problem</h4>\n                <p>\n                    One aspect of the problem is student engagement. As students respond well to gamification or game-based learning,\n                    a solution could be a math app that positions problems in the form of a game.  Another aspect of the problem is broadening the student’s toolset in solving math problems.\n                    A technology solution would allow the student to have a greater amount of randomized problems that require the user to solve them in different ways.\n                    Lastly, students may have trouble acquiring resources outside of school that will help fortify their math education.\n                    An online solution would allow them to have access to problems anywhere.\n                    </p>\n            </div>\n            <div id='habihero-paper'>\n                <iframe title='Habi Hero: An Online Math Resource for First Grade Students'\n                    src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/19JYGAFIVOcd920waF8Ibto050LlBl9hd/preview\"\n                    frameBorder=\"0\" />\n            </div>\n            <motion.div className='hero-shrug'\n                initial={{ y: '40vh'}} \n                animate={{ y: (progress > 0.99) ? 0 : '40vh'}}\n                transition={{ duration: 0.5 }} >\n                <img id='hero-shrug' src='../img/projects/habihero/hero-shrug.png' alt='Habi hero shrugging' />\n            </motion.div>\n            <div className='initial-design-container'>\n                <h3>Initial Design</h3>\n                <div className='wireframe-container'>\n                    <img className='wireframe' src='../img/projects/habihero/paper-wireframe.png' alt='paper wireframe for Habi Hero' />\n                    <div className='wireframe-description'>\n                        <h4>Paper Wireframe</h4>\n                        <p>\n                            In our initial wireframe, users are first taken to a level selection screen where they can choose the Common Core math standard they wish to practice and the endangered animal they will help save.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                            Upon selecting the level, the user is taken to the endangered animal’s environment where they will see various real-world threats to endangered animals.\n                            When the user clicks on a threat within the environment a modal will appear with a math problem that they must solve in order to eliminate the threat from the game’s environment.\n                            After correctly answering the problem the environmental threat will then disappear from the level’s environment and the user may select and solve other threats until they all are completed.\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div className='low-fidelity-container'>\n                    <img className='low-fidelity' src='../img/projects/habihero/low-fidelity.png' alt='low-fidelity prototype for Habi Hero' />\n                    <div className='low-fidelity-description'>\n                        <h4>Low-fidelity Prototype</h4>\n                        <p>\n                            The main additions that we made to our design in this stage was the addition of a leveling progression and a coin reward system.\n                            A leveling system was added to the design to help promote the values of motivation and engagement for first grade users; incentivizing them to continue playing the game in order to level up.\n                            Finally, we decided to incorporate a coin reward system in our design to further engage students and maintain their motivation in practicing math. This coin system acts to positively reinforce students\n                            to complete math problems so that they may gain in game rewards. Lastly, we decided to opt for a writing-to-text input to reinforce the practice of transcribing numbers.\n                            As for the graphics, we used temporary stock images for our characters.\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className='visual-elements-container'>\n                <div className='visual-elements'>\n                    <h3>Visual Elements</h3>\n                    <p>\n                        It was important for us to determine branding that was both appealing to 1st graders and relevant to our secondary mission of environmental impact.\n                        We decided to use a color palette that was soft, but simultaenously bright. Shades of green and blue helped tie in our theme of conservation.\n                        As for the game characters, it was important for us to keep as much of the endangered animal’s physical features as realistic as possible.\n                        We did not want our animal characters to be caricatures and disassociate the Habi Hero environment from the actual world.\n                        For our Habi Heroes, we opted for a simple hero design. Both gender and race could be adjusted when creating an account.\n                        </p>\n                </div>\n                <div className='visual-container'>\n                    <div className='visual-columns'>\n                        <figure id='habihero-colors'>\n                            <img src='../img/projects/habihero/colors.png' alt='Habi Hero color palette' />\n                            <figcaption><span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Figure 1:</span> Color Palette</figcaption>\n                        </figure>\n                        <div className='visual-rows'>\n                            <figure id='habihero-logo'>\n                                <img src='../img/projects/habihero/habihero-logo.png' alt='Habi Hero logo' />\n                                <figcaption><span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Figure 2:</span> Habi Hero logo</figcaption>\n                            </figure>\n                            <figure id='habihero-icon'>\n                                <img src='../img/projects/habihero/habihero-icon.png' alt='Habi Hero icon' />\n                                <figcaption><span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Figure 3:</span> Habi Hero icon</figcaption>\n                            </figure>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    <figure>\n                        <img id='characters' src='../img/projects/habihero/habihero-characters.png' alt='Habi Hero character, Lily Panda, Habi-coin' />\n                        <figcaption><span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Figure 4:</span> Habi Hero character, Lily Panda, and Habi-coin</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className='high-fidelity-container'>\n                <h3>High-fidelity Prototype</h3>\n                <p>\n                    Upon reviewing our investigations of the stakeholders' values, value tensions, and value scenario, we made several additions and changes to our design.\n                    We decided that Habi Hero should also incorporate a way for teachers to use our design in order to better promote the values of effectiveness, accessibility, and customization in practicing Common Core Standards.\n                    Teachers can create and customize lessons, as well as, view student progress and results. In this final prototype, we also gave students ways to customize their hero avatar to further promote engagement with the game.\n                    By redeeming their coins through additional customizations for their hero avatar, our game gives them greater motivation to continue playing.\n                    </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className='screens-container'>\n                <div className='screen-container'>\n                    <img src='../img/projects/habihero/game-main.png' alt='Habi Hero game main page' />\n                </div>\n                <div className='screen-container'>\n                    <img src='../img/projects/habihero/game-environment.png' alt='Habi Hero tiger environment' />\n                </div>\n                <div className='screen-container'>\n                    <img src='../img/projects/habihero/game-modal.png' alt='Habi Hero game modal' />\n                </div>\n                <div className='screen-container'>\n                    <img src='../img/projects/habihero/game-shop.png' alt='Habi Hero game shop' />\n                </div>\n                <div className='screen-container'>\n                    <img src='../img/projects/habihero/teacher-class.png' alt='Habi Hero teacher class view' />\n                </div>\n                <div className='screen-container'>\n                    <img src='../img/projects/habihero/teacher-lessons.png' alt='Habi Hero teacher lesson view' />\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className='links-container'>\n                <h3>Links</h3>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <span style={{ color: '#516b5c' }}>Github Repository: &nbsp;</span>\n                        <a href=\"https://github.com/jyu98-1661808/capstone2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n                            https://github.com/jyu98-1661808/capstone2020\n                        </a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <span style={{ color: '#516b5c' }}>Landing Page: &nbsp;</span>\n                        <a href=\"https://jyu98-1661808.github.io/capstone2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n                            https://jyu98-1661808.github.io/capstone2020\n                        </a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <span style={{ color: '#516b5c' }}>Pitch Deck: &nbsp;</span>\n                        <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EGzGdSX0BvIwRmu-XbCayvh9d28VO5R-/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n                            https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EGzGdSX0BvIwRmu-XbCayvh9d28VO5R-/view?usp=sharing\n                        </a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <span style={{ color: '#516b5c' }}>Poster Page: &nbsp;</span>\n                        <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mcxTEdq7NL_BfN0iMd1nVTC3hMIe0BeD/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n                            https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mcxTEdq7NL_BfN0iMd1nVTC3hMIe0BeD/view?usp=sharing\n                        </a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <span style={{ color: '#516b5c' }}>Research Paper: &nbsp;</span>\n                        <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/19JYGAFIVOcd920waF8Ibto050LlBl9hd/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n                            https://drive.google.com/file/d/19JYGAFIVOcd920waF8Ibto050LlBl9hd/view?usp=sharing\n                        </a>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n            <div className='next-container'>\n                <NavLink\n                    id='first-project'\n                    to=\"/projects/fresh\"\n                    onMouseEnter={() => setHovered(true)}\n                    onMouseLeave={() => setHovered(false)}\n                >\n                    <motion.img\n                        id='smile-logo'\n                        src='../img/projects/smile-logo.png'\n                        alt='smile logo'\n                        whileHover={{\n                            rotate: 360,\n                            transition: { duration: 1 },\n                        }}\n                    />\n                </NavLink>\n                <motion.img\n                    id='next-arrow'\n                    src='../img/projects/next-project.png'\n                    alt='Next project'\n                    animate={{ scale: isHovered ? 1.2 : 1 }}\n                    transition={{ duration: 0.35 }}\n                />\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default HabiHero;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
